      <h1>lease or<br />
        finance?</h1>
      <p>The decision to lease or finance depends on many factors, but most make the decision based on monthly payments and how long they typically drive their vehicles.</p>
      <p>In general, those who lease prefer to drive a new car every 2-3 years and appreciate making lower monthly payments. For those who use their vehicle for business reasons, there may also be additional tax advantages with leasing.</p>
      <p>Most who finance their vehicles tend to drive them for five to 10 years and appreciate driving without mileage limitations.</p>
      <p>Explore the detailed benefits of leasing and financing below.</p>
