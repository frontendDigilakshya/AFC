      <h1>lease or<br />
        finance?</h1>
      <p>The decision to lease or finance depends on many factors, but most make the decision based on monthly payments and how long they typically drive their vehicles.</p>
      <p>In general, those who lease prefer to drive a new car every 2-3 years and appreciate making lower monthly payments. For those who use their vehicle for business reasons, there may also be additional tax advantages with leasing.</p>
      <p>Most who finance their vehicles tend to drive them for five to 10 years and appreciate driving without mileage limitations.</p>
      <p>Explore the detailed benefits of leasing and financing below.</p>

    <h3>drive the vehicle at its prime</h3>
    In a lease, you contract to enjoy a new vehicle for a specified period of time. You can also choose to lease one of our premier Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles.</section>
  
  <!--Section-->
  <section class="paddingAll30 comman-cont-section gray-bg">
    <h3>less cash up front</h3>
    One of the biggest advantages of a lease is that it does not usually require a substantial down payment. In many states, you can even pay the sales taxes as part of your monthly lease payment, rather than in a lump sum. </section>
  
  <!--Section-->
  <section class="paddingAll30 comman-cont-section blue-bg">
    <h3>lower monthly payment</h3>
    If the finance period is the same, your monthly payments will generally be lower when leasing (vs. traditional financing) because your payments will be based on the vehicle's estimated depreciation. (You are contracting to use a portion of the car's value, rather than buying the entire car). </section>
  
  <!--Section-->
  <section class="paddingAll30 comman-cont-section gray-bg">
    <h3>a new car more often</h3>
    A short-term lease makes it easy to drive a new car more frequently. Plus, if life changes demand a larger or smaller car in a few years, a lease can make it easier to plan and adapt. </section>
  
  <!--Section-->
  <section class="paddingAll30 comman-cont-section blue-bg">
    <h3>guaranteed future value </h3>
    You don't have to worry about resale value. If your car depreciates more than the estimated residual value in your lease contract at full term, you can turn it in at the end of your lease term. But if it's worth more, you can purchase it. </section>

  <section class="paddingAll30 comman-cont-section gray-bg">
    <h3>tax advantage for business use</h3>
    People who use a lease car for business may find larger tax deductions with leasing than with buying a vehicle. Check with your tax advisor. </section>
